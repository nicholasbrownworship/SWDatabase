  "description": "The UT-60D U-wing serves the Rebel Alliance as a versatile troop transport and gunship. Folding wings and a reinforced hull allow it to insert squads into hot landing zones while providing covering fire through side-mounted doors. Equipped with hyperdrive and modest armament, U-wings are commonly used for covert insertions, extractions, and resupply missions where standard shuttles would draw too much attention. Many crews personalize their U-wings with improvised armor, sensor jammers, or hidden cargo compartments.",
