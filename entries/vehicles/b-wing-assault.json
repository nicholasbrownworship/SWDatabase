  "description": "The A/SF-01 B-wing is a heavy assault starfighter designed to punch above its weight against capital ships. Its rotating cockpit and asymmetrical frame house a formidable array of laser cannons, ion cannons, and ordnance launchers. Complex systems and awkward handling make the B-wing difficult to fly, requiring extensive training and a steady hand. In the right pilot’s control, however, a flight of B-wings can cripple or destroy larger Imperial vessels that once seemed untouchable to small Rebel strike forces.",
