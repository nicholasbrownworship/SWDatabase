  "description": "The Mk I Dark Trooper is an experimental Imperial combat droid designed as a replacement for standard stormtroopers. Encased in heavy plating and powered by advanced servomotors, Mk I units are slow but relentless, marching through small-arms fire and smashing obstacles with hydraulic limbs. Their intimidating presence and mechanical brutality often break enemy morale before the first blow lands.",
