  "description": "The sarlacc is an ancient, immobile apex predator buried beneath desert sands, leaving only a tooth-ringed maw visible at the surface. Its tentacles drag prey downward into a stomach that slowly digests victims over decades while keeping them alive. Many desert cultures consider sarlacc pits cursed or sacred, warning travelers never to cross dune basins without a long-range scanner or speeder bike.",
