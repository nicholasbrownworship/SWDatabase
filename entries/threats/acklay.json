  "description": "Acklays are towering crustacean-like predators armed with three serrated forelimbs used for both hunting and defense. Amphibious and territorial, they stalk coastal shallows and dense reef structures. Their hardened exoskeleton resists small-arms fire, and their piercing screech causes panic in most humanoids. Acklays are often captured for gladiatorial arenas—few handlers survive the attempt.",
