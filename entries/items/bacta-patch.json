  "description": "A bacta patch is a disposable dressing infused with a thin layer of bacta gel. Pressed directly against a wound, it numbs pain and accelerates healing far beyond natural recovery. While not as powerful as full submersion in a bacta tank, patches are portable, relatively affordable, and a common sight in military field kits and smuggler hideouts alike.",
