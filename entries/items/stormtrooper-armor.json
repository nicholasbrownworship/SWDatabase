  "description": "Standard white plastoid armor worn by Imperial stormtroopers provides limited protection against blaster fire, environmental hazards, and shrapnel. Integrated systems include a comlink, environmental seals suitable for brief vacuum exposure, and a built-in heads-up display with limited tactical data. While intimidating in formation, the armor’s visibility issues and rigid plating can hinder awareness and movement—weaknesses that experienced foes learn to exploit.",
