  "description": "Datapads are ubiquitous in the galaxy, used for everything from starport paperwork and cargo manifests to personal journals and encrypted Rebel directives. A typical unit features a holo-capable display, onboard storage, and connection ports for slicing tools or security modules. In the right hands—and with the right access codes—a datapad is both a portable library and a key to sensitive systems.",
