  "description": "Fragmentation grenades are simple, brutal weapons: a timed charge wrapped in a shell designed to shatter into razor-sharp fragments. They are used by both Imperial troops and irregular forces when clearing trenches, corridors, and tight defensive positions. While far less destructive than a thermal detonator, frag grenades are easier to acquire in bulk and can be locally manufactured in a pinch, making them a staple of ground combat.",
