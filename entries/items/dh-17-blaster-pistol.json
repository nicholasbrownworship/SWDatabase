  "description": "The DH-17 is a reliable sidearm commonly issued to Rebel troops and starship crews. Larger and more rugged than a civilian hold-out pistol, it offers a solid balance between rate of fire and stopping power at close to medium range. Its design tolerates sand, moisture, and abuse, making it a favorite among those who do not have the luxury of regular armory maintenance.",
