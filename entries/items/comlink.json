  "description": "A standard comlink is a handheld or wrist-mounted short-range communicator used by soldiers, pilots, and civilians alike. Most models support encrypted channels, basic frequency hopping, and a limited distress beacon function. In quiet sectors, comlinks blend into the background of daily life; under Imperial scrutiny, carrying one tuned to the wrong channel can be enough to invite questions—and trouble.",
