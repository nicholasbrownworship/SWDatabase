  "description": "Corellia is a bustling Core World known across the galaxy for its shipyards and its daring pilots. Towering drydocks and orbital construction rings constantly assemble and refit freighters, starfighters, and capital ships for both commercial clients and the Imperial Navy. On the surface, crowded cities sprawl along industrial canals and aging infrastructure, mixing corporate offices with worker tenements, black-market chop shops, and seedy spacer bars. The Empire keeps a tight grip on Corellia’s output but relies heavily on local corporations and dockworkers, creating cracks in oversight that smugglers, informants, and Rebel agents are all too eager to exploit. Many ships that later serve the Rebellion—or disappear from Imperial registries entirely—can trace their origins back to Corellian yards.",
