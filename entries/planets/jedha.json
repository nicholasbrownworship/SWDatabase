  "description": "Jedha is a cold desert moon long regarded as a holy site by those who revere the Force. Ancient temples and weathered statues rise from windswept plateaus and canyon walls, their origins lost in myth and half-remembered records. Pilgrims from across the galaxy once traveled to the city of NiJedha to meditate, trade relics, and seek guidance from its guardians. Under the Empire, Jedha has become a battlefield: Imperial forces strip-mine kyber crystals from the moon’s crust while insurgents wage a desperate resistance in its streets and surrounding wastelands. The air carries dust, ash, and the echoes of old hymns—alongside the thunder of tanks and the howl of TIE engines overhead.",
