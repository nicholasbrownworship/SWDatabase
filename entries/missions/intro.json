  "description": "Classification: RESTRICTED â€” Alliance Intelligence (Level 3)\n\nTwo weeks after the Battle of Yavin, your team, Phoenix Cell 'Sparrow', is tasked with a low-priority mission on Kestrel-9, an ice-mining moon in the Outer Rim. Your objective is to infiltrate a small Imperial logistics node, retrieve the current shipping manifest and patrol rotation logs from terminal VEGA-3, and upload a forged maintenance manifest to cover Alliance access. You should also recover a single labeled fuel canister tag if safe.\n\nThis mission is intended as a training exercise for new recruits. Avoid lethal force where possible, do not destroy infrastructure, and maintain minimal trace. Timing is critical: you have a 90-minute on-station window before the next supply run. Insertion is via shuttle under ice-shadow at 0200 local time, and exfil is to docking ring Echo-4. If extraction fails, fallback rally point is abandoned fuel silo 'Silo B-12'.\n\nBring back the manifests, cover your tracks, and return your team safely.",
